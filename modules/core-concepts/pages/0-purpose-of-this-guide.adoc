:description: Why another OFBiz manual and what you will gain from it.

Apache OFBiz is a rich yet sprawling platform. Official documentation exists, but it is scattered across wiki pages, PDFs, JIRA tickets, and mailing-list threads. This guide consolidates that tribal knowledge into a linear, diff-friendly _AsciiDoc_ reference targeted at senior Java developers and integration engineers.

WHY IT MATTERS::  The faster you understand _how_ and _why_ OFBiz works, the sooner you can extend it safely. Reverse-engineering the framework is expensive; this guide front-loads that cost so you can focus on delivering business value.

.What makes this guide different
* **Source-driven.** Each paragraph cites its origin so you can verify and dig deeper.
* **Up-to-date.** Outdated statements are marked `VERIFY:` or `TODO:` so the community can patch them quickly.
* **Integrator-centric.** We assume you live in the CLI, debug Java, and care about deployment pipelines.
* **Antora-ready.** Content is modular and versioned, easing long-term maintenance.

.Scope
This Part I covers the conceptual bedrock—*origins*, *strengths*, and a *30 000-ft architecture tour*. Later parts dive into hands-on tasks: building plug-ins, customizing data models, and operating OFBiz in production.

.Prerequisites
An intermediate grasp of Java, Gradle, and relational databases. Familiarity with MVC and SOA patterns will help, but is not mandatory.
