NOTE: PlantUML diagrams render automatically in Antora when the `antora-site.yml` includes the `antora-kroki` extension.

== Entity Engine
A thin ORM and transaction manager. Tables are defined in XML (`entitymodel.xml`), then accessed via the `Delegator` API. VERIFY: starting version of Delegator.

* **Why it matters**: Enables database-agnostic portability; model changes auto-generate DDL during `gradlew ofbiz --load-data`.
* **Gotcha**: No lazy-loading; fetching large relations can explode memory. ([source: JIRA OFBIZ-11924])

== Service Engine
The SOA heart. Services declared in `services.xml` may be Java, Groovy, or Minilang. Synchronous or asynchronous via the `JobManager`.

WHY IT MATTERS:: Decouples business logic from UI and persistence; enables REST or SOAP wrappers.

== Widget Layer
Freemarker + XML DSL that renders Screens, Forms, and Menus. While dated, it enforces consistency and permissions via the controller.

TIP: Use the *Theme* mechanism to swap look-and-feel without touching business widgets. ([source: docs 22.01 Front-end Guide])

== Plug-in Model
OFBiz core is frozen; extensions live in `plugins/`. A plug-in can ship entities, services, webapps, tests.

.Command to generate a scaffold

./gradlew createPlugin --pluginId=myshop --pluginResourceName="My Shop"

CAUTION: Keep custom code out of `applications/` to stay upgrade-safe.
