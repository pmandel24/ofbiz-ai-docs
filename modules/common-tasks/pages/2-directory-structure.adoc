:description: Navigating the OFBiz source tree.

Understanding the OFBiz directory layout is key to finding code, customizing applications, and managing extensions.

== Top-Level Directories

.Key Directories in OFBiz Root
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Directory | Purpose

| `applications/`
| Core OFBiz applications (Order, Catalog, Accounting, etc.). *CAUTION: Do not modify code here directly.*

| `framework/`
| The core framework libraries (Entity Engine, Service Engine, etc.).

| `plugins/`
| The designated home for all custom extensions and third-party plug-ins. Your custom code lives here.

| `runtime/`
| Contains logs, temporary files, and data for the running instance. Not version-controlled.

| `themes/`
| Global look-and-feel themes that can be applied to the entire application suite.
|===

WHY IT MATTERS:: The strict separation between `applications/` (core) and `plugins/` (custom) is the foundation of OFBiz's upgrade path. By keeping your changes isolated in a plug-in, you can update the core framework without complex code merges.

== Inside a Plug-in
A well-formed plug-in mirrors the main OFBiz structure, allowing it to ship its own entities, services, and web applications.
