:description: A tour of the Gradle-based command-line interface.

OFBiz provides a unified Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) for all essential developer tasks, from loading data to running tests. Mastering these commands is the fastest way to become productive.

== Core Commands

.Common Gradle Tasks
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Command | Description

| `./gradlew ofbiz`
| The main task for running OFBiz. Appends `--start`, `--shutdown`, `--status`.

| `./gradlew loadDefault`
| Loads the default seed and demo data for all applications. Destructive; resets databases.

| `./gradlew cleanAll loadAll`
| A common chain to wipe all data and reload it. Useful for dev environments.

| `./gradlew testIntegration`
| Runs all integration tests across the framework and applications.

| `./gradlew createPlugin`
| Scaffolds a new plug-in with a standard directory structure.
|===

WHY IT MATTERS:: A consistent CLI prevents "works on my machine" problems. The Gradle wrapper ensures every developer uses the same build logic and dependencies, which is critical for team-based projects.

== Interactive Shell
For more advanced debugging or system inspection, you can launch an interactive Groovy shell with full access to the running OFBiz instance.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew ofbiz --shell
----

Once inside, you have access to the `delegator` and `dispatcher` objects.

.Example: Querying an entity from the shell
[source,groovy]
----
// Find the 'admin' user
adminUser = delegator.findOne("UserLogin", [userLoginId: "admin"], false)
println "Admin email: " + adminUser.email
----

CAUTION: The shell has full admin rights. Be careful running commands that modify data.
